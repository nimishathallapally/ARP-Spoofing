## 🎯 Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
cd /home/nimisha/Files/Courses/ARP_SPOOFING/arp_spoofing_detection_project

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2: Prepare Data

```bash
# Copy your datasets to data/raw/
cp ../dataset/*.csv data/raw/

# Verify files
ls -lh data/raw/
```

### Step 3: Train the Model

```bash
# Run training pipeline
python scripts/train_model.py

# Expected output:
# - Training logs in outputs/logs/
# - Trained model in models/saved_models/arp_spoofing_detector.pkl
# - Metrics in outputs/reports/model_metrics.json
```

### Step 4: Generate All Visualizations

```bash
# Generate all EDA and evaluation plots
python scripts/generate_plots.py

# Expected output:
# - 12+ visualization files in outputs/plots/
# - Class distributions, correlation matrices, confusion matrices
# - ROC curves, feature importance, detection timeline
```

### Step 5: Run Real-Time Detection Demo

```bash
# Run simulation with 100 packets
python scripts/detect_realtime.py

# Or with custom parameters
python scripts/detect_realtime.py --packets 200
```
