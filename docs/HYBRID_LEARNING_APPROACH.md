# Hybrid Learning Approach for ARP Spoofing Detection

## Overview
This project implements a **mandatory hybrid learning approach** that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect ARP spoofing attacks. This approach satisfies the course requirement of incorporating both learning paradigms.

---

## 1. Supervised Learning Component

### Purpose
- Detect **known attack patterns** using labeled training data
- Achieve high accuracy on previously seen attack signatures
- Provide baseline detection capabilities

### Models Implemented
Our system includes **four supervised classifiers**:

#### 1.1 Random Forest (Primary Supervised Model)
```python
# Location: src/models.py, line 70-75
'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=20,
    min_samples_split=5,
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1
)
```
- **Performance**: 96.00% accuracy, 95.98% F1-score
- **Strength**: Handles non-linear patterns, feature importance
- **Role**: Best performing supervised model, selected as primary detector

#### 1.2 Gradient Boosting
```python
# Location: src/models.py, line 76-81
'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=150,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=5,
    min_samples_split=5,
    random_state=42
)
```
- **Performance**: 95.30% accuracy, 95.25% F1-score
- **Strength**: Sequential error correction
- **Role**: Secondary supervised classifier

#### 1.3 Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
```python
# Location: src/models.py, line 82-88
'Neural Network': MLPClassifier(
    hidden_layer_sizes=(128, 64, 32),
    activation='relu',
    solver='adam',
    max_iter=500,
    random_state=42,
    early_stopping=True
)
```
- **Performance**: 93.95% accuracy, 93.85% F1-score
- **Strength**: Deep pattern recognition
- **Role**: Tertiary supervised classifier

#### 1.4 Logistic Regression (Baseline)
```python
# Location: src/models.py, line 89-91
'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(
    max_iter=1000,
    random_state=42
)
```
- **Performance**: 78.69% accuracy, 79.48% F1-score
- **Strength**: Fast, interpretable baseline
- **Role**: Comparative baseline

### Training Process
```python
# Location: src/models.py, lines 103-123
def train_supervised_models(self, X_train, y_train):
    """Train all supervised models on labeled data"""
    for name, model in self.models.items():
        if name == 'Isolation Forest':
            continue  # Skip unsupervised model
        
        logger.info(f"\nTraining {name}...")
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        logger.info(f"  ✓ {name} trained successfully")
        self.trained_models.add(name)
```

**Training Data**: 110,902 labeled samples (50% normal, 50% attack)

---

## 2. Unsupervised Learning Component

### Purpose
- Detect **unknown/novel attack patterns** not present in training data
- Identify **zero-day attacks** and emerging threats
- Model "normal" behavior and flag deviations as anomalies

### Model Implemented: Isolation Forest

#### 2.1 Configuration
```python
# Location: src/models.py, lines 92-98
'Isolation Forest': IsolationForest(
    n_estimators=150,
    contamination=0.1,  # Expect 10% anomalies
    max_samples='auto',
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

#### 2.2 Training (Unsupervised - No Labels Used)
```python
# Location: src/models.py, lines 125-152
def train_unsupervised_model(self, X_train: np.ndarray) -> IsolationForest:
    """
    Train Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.
    
    Key Feature: Trains on unlabeled data to model normal behavior
    """
    logger.info("\n" + "="*60)
    logger.info("TRAINING UNSUPERVISED MODEL (Isolation Forest)")
    logger.info("="*60)
    
    iso_forest = self.models.get('Isolation Forest')
    
    if iso_forest is None:
        raise ValueError("Isolation Forest not initialized")
    
    # Train on data WITHOUT using labels
    # This models the normal behavior pattern
    logger.info("Training Isolation Forest for anomaly detection...")
    iso_forest.fit(X_train)  # Note: NO y_train parameter
    logger.info("  ✓ Isolation Forest trained successfully")
    
    self.trained_models.add('Isolation Forest')
    return iso_forest
```

**Key Characteristic**: Trained on **unlabeled data** (X_train only, no y_train)
- Models the structure and distribution of "normal" network traffic
- Identifies outliers/anomalies without knowing attack labels
- Can detect **previously unseen attack patterns**

#### 2.3 Detection Mechanism
```python
# Location: src/models.py, lines 174-184
if model_name == 'Isolation Forest':
    # Isolation Forest returns -1 for anomalies, 1 for normal
    y_pred_raw = model.predict(X_test)
    y_pred = np.where(y_pred_raw == -1, 1, 0)  # Convert to binary
    
    # Calculate anomaly scores (more negative = more anomalous)
    anomaly_scores = model.decision_function(X_test)
    y_prob = 1 / (1 + np.exp(anomaly_scores))  # Sigmoid transform
```

**Anomaly Detection**:
- Returns `-1` for anomalies (potential attacks)
- Returns `1` for normal behavior
- Detects deviations from learned "normal" patterns

---

## 3. Hybrid Ensemble (Combining Both Approaches)

### Purpose
Leverage **both supervised and unsupervised strengths**:
- Supervised: High accuracy on known attacks
- Unsupervised: Detection of novel/unknown attacks

### Implementation
```python
# Location: src/models.py, lines 332-387
def create_hybrid_ensemble(self, 
                          supervised_models: Dict,
                          iso_forest: IsolationForest,
                          X_test: np.ndarray,
                          y_test: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Dict]:
    """
    Create hybrid ensemble combining supervised and unsupervised predictions.
    
    Strategy: If EITHER approach detects an attack, flag it
    """
    
    # Step 1: Get supervised predictions (average of all classifiers)
    supervised_preds = []
    for name, model in supervised_models.items():
        if name == 'Isolation Forest':
            continue
        pred = model.predict(X_test)
        supervised_preds.append(pred)
    
    supervised_avg = np.mean(supervised_preds, axis=0)
    supervised_final = (supervised_avg >= 0.5).astype(int)
    
    # Step 2: Get unsupervised predictions
    iso_pred_raw = iso_forest.predict(X_test)
    iso_pred = np.where(iso_pred_raw == -1, 1, 0)
    
    # Step 3: HYBRID COMBINATION (OR logic)
    # Flag as attack if EITHER supervised OR unsupervised detects it
    ensemble_pred = np.where((supervised_final == 1) | (iso_pred == 1), 1, 0)
    
    return ensemble_pred, metrics
```

### Ensemble Strategy
**OR Logic**: `Attack = Supervised_Attack OR Unsupervised_Anomaly`

**Rationale**:
- **High Recall**: Catches both known and unknown attacks
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supervised handles known patterns, unsupervised catches novel ones
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple detection layers

## 4. Hybrid Feature Selection

### Purpose
Select most informative features using multiple statistical methods

### Implementation
```python
# Location: src/feature_engineering.py, lines 198-279
def select_features_hybrid(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: np.ndarray, k: int = 25):
    """
    Select features using hybrid approach (combination of methods).
    
    Methods Combined:
    1. F-test (ANOVA) - Statistical significance
    2. Mutual Information - Information gain
    3. Random Forest Importance - Tree-based importance
    
    Voting: Features that appear in multiple methods are selected
    """
    logger.info(f"\nSelecting top {k} features using hybrid approach...")
    
    # Method 1: F-test
    f_features = self.select_features_f_test(X, y, k)
    
    # Method 2: Mutual Information
    mi_features = self.select_features_mutual_info(X, y, k)
    
    # Method 3: Random Forest Importance
    rf_features = self.select_features_rf_importance(X, y, k)
    
    # Voting mechanism
    feature_votes = {}
    for f in f_features + mi_features + rf_features:
        feature_votes[f] = feature_votes.get(f, 0) + 1
    
    # Select top k by votes
    selected = sorted(feature_votes.items(), 
                     key=lambda x: x[1], 
                     reverse=True)[:k]
    
    return [f[0] for f in selected]
```

**Selected Features** (25 total):
- `avg_packet_size`, `bidirectional_mean_ps`, `bidirectional_max_ps`
- `src2dst_mean_piat_ms`, `bidirectional_stddev_ps`
- And 20 more...

# Location: scripts/train_model.py, lines 80-102

# Step 1: Train supervised models (with labels)
model_trainer.train_supervised_models(X_train, y_train)

def detect(self, features: np.ndarray) -> Dict:
    """

    # Unsupervised anomaly detection
    if self.unsupervised_model:
        anomaly_score = self.unsupervised_model.decision_function(features_scaled)[0]
        is_anomaly = anomaly_score < 0  # Negative = anomaly
    
    # Hybrid decision
    if supervised_label == 'arp_spoofing' or is_anomaly:
        final_label = 'arp_spoofing'
        final_prob = max(supervised_prob, 0.8 if is_anomaly else 0)
    else:
        final_label = 'normal'
        final_prob = supervised_prob
    
    return {
        'label': final_label,

    }

```

**Note**: Isolation Forest has lower accuracy because:
- It's trained **without labels** (unsupervised)
- Optimized for **anomaly detection**, not classification
- Detects **novel patterns** supervised models might miss
- Complements supervised models in hybrid ensemble
